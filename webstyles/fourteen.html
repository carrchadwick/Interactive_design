   <h1>On Invisibility

    Capable of anything. Sometimes, suddenly, the question arises: might masterpieces be nothing but alibis?

     ESSAI DE CRITIQUE INDIRECTE
    </p><br><p>
    It seams to me that invisibility is the required provision of elegance. Elegance ceases to exist when it is noticed. Poetry, being elegance itself, cannot hope to achieve visibility. In that case, you ask me, of what use is it? Of no use. Who will see it? No one. Which does not prevent it from being an outrage to modesty, though its exhibitionism is squandered on the blind. It is enough for poetry to express a personal ethic, which can then break away in the form of a work. It insists on living its own life. It becomes the pretext for a thousand misunderstandings that go by the name of glory.
    </p><p>
    Glory is absurd, stemming as it does from the herding instinct. A crowd gathers around an accident, discusses it, reinvents it, worries at it until it has become something wholly different. 
    </p><p>
    Beauty is always the result of an accident. Of a violent lapse between acquired habits and those yet to be acquired. It baffles and disgusts. It may even horrify. Once the new habit has been acquired, the accident ceases to be an accident. It becomes classical and loses its shock value. A work, therefore, is never perceived. It is received. If I am not mistaken, this was a remark made by Eugene Delacroix: <blockquote>"One is never perceived, one is received."</blockquote> <p>It is a maxim frequently repeated by Matisse. Those who actually way the accident hasten away, overwhelmed, unable to describe it. Those who did not see it are left to bear witness. This opportunity to make themselves seem important provides the medium through which they express their stupidity. The accident remains in the road, bloodied, petrified, awful in its solitude, a prey to gossip and police reports. 
    </p><p>
    The inaccuracy of such gossip and such reports is not exclusively the result of distraction. It has more solid roots. It is closely related to the genesis of myth. Man seeks to escape himself in myth, and does so by any means at his disposal. Drugs, alcohol, or lies. Unable to withdraw into himself, he disguises himself. Lies and inaccuracy give him a few moments of comfort, the trifling feeling of escape experienced at at a masked ball. He distances himself from that which he feels and sees. He invents. He transfigures. He mythifies. He creates. He fancies himself an artist. He imitates, in his small way, the painters he claims are mad. 
    </p><p>
    Journalist know this, or a least sense it. The inaccuracies of the press, and the banner headlines by which they are trumpeted, are soothing draughts to this thirst for the unreal. Sadly, no authority presides in this case over the model’s metamorphosis into a work of art.  But it is this bland metamorphosis that demonstrates the need for myth. Accuracy is vexing to a crowd of would-be fantasizes. Hasn’t our age coined the term “escapism,” when in fact the only way to escape oneself is to allow oneself to be invaded?
    </p><p>
    It is for this reason that fantasy is detestable. People confuse it with poetry, whose modesty consists of masking its own equations. Its realism depicts a very strange reality, intrinsic to the poet who uncovers it and who is determined never to betray it.
    </p><p>
    Poetry is a religion without hope. The poet exhausts himself in its service, knowing that, in the long run, a masterpiece is nothing but the performance of a trained dog on very shaky ground. 
    </p><p>
    Naturally, he consoles himself with the illusion that his work is grounded in some more concrete mystery. But this hope comes from the fact that every man is a night (harbors a night), that an artist’s task is to bring that night into the light of day, and that this secular night provides a comforting extension of man’s severe limitations. Man thereby becomes a sort of sleeping cripple, dreaming that he can walk. 
    </p><p>
    Poetry is an this. By ethic I mean a secret code of behavior, a discipline constructed and conducted according to the capabilities of a man who rejects the falsifications of the categorical imperative.

    His personal morality may appear to be immorality itself in the eyes of those who lie to themselves, or who live a life of confusion, in such a manner that, for them, a lie becomes the truth, and our truth becomes a lie. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
    It is in regard to this principle that I wrote that Genet is a moralist, and that “I am a lie that always tells the truth,” a saying on which asses have grazed and frolicked with great relish. This saying was meant to imply that t man is a social lie. The poet takes up arms against this social lie particularly when he upbraidles its monadic truth and charges it with mendacity. Nothing is more bitter than the defense which the plural puts up agains the singular. Parrots of every feather squawk, “He’s lying. He’s a swindler, when a person devotes himself to never lying. Once, a young woman who was arguing with me cried out: “Your truth is not mine.” I should hope not. 
    </p><p>
    For that matter, how could I lie? In relation to what? To what purpose? By what right? I am on the one hand too lazy, and on the other too respectful of the inner orders that direct me, that compel me to overcome my laziness, and that don’t waste their time catering to scandalmongers. 
    </p><p>
    I have even reached the point where I am no longer aware of censure, being too engrossed in my ethic. (I wrote in Le coq et l’arelequin: “We shelter an angel within us. We must be the guardians of that angle.:) It is an ethic that I have perfected to the point of surrounding myself with friends who observe me with a steely gaze, and never let my slightest mistake go by unnoted. The sort of friends in whom goodness, grace, and virtue possess the kind of violence usually associated with spitefulness, foibles, and vice. 
    </p><p>
    I call a work of art the sweat of this ethic.
    </p><p>
    Any work that is not the seat of an ethic, and work not stemming from an exertion of the soul’s will more strenuous than any physical labor, and work that is too visible (since the personal ethic and the works of art it engenders cannot be seen by those who live without an ethic, or who are content to follow a standardized code), any work that persuades too readily, will be but a decorative fantasy. It will please because it will not require the listener to subordinate his own personality to the personality of the speaker. It will allow the critics and those who defer to them to recognize it—and to recognize themselves int it— with a cursory glance. Yet beauty cannot be recognized with a cursory glance.
