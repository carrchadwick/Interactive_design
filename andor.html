And/Or Gallery originally operated in Dallas, Texas from 2006-2009 and showed contemporary art with an emphasis on new media. It was one of the few spaces in the country with the equipment and expertise to exhibit new media artwork as intended, and pioneered new methods of archiving and displaying new media artwork and websites. The gallery represented ten artists.

Paul Slocum: owner and director

Michelle Proksell: curatorial assistant

<mark> >> What prompted the idea to start a gallery?</mark>
<br>

At the time I was working on this idea to create a non-profit that put on one-night new media performances and exhibitions.
I had put on one show that included performances and a screening of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN-WCA5-Qxs"> Super Mario Movie</a> by <a href="http://www.coryarcangel.com/">Cory Arcangel</a> and <a href="http://www.paperrad.org/">Paper Rad</a>.
My girlfriend and bandmate at the time (Lauren Gray) was working on starting an art gallery, and we ended up partnering on it
when she rented the space.  Eventually Lauren left the gallery, and she now runs a cool gallery in Dallas that focuses on traditional media.
<br>


The gallery was inspired by spaces/festivals where I'd exhibited and where Lauren and I had performed together like 
Flux Factory in New York, Alexei Shulgins README festival, and Le Conforte Moderne in France.
</p><br><p>

<mark> >> What was the internet community like at that time? I.e. social platforms, sites, posting etc. </mark>
<br>
I think that social media felt less significant at the time.  Me and many of the artists I showed
had our own network of blogs that we read through RSS, and also group blogs that we all contributed to 
like Nasty Nets and later <a href="http://www.spiritsurfers.net/"> Spirit Surfers</a>.
</p><br><p>


<mark> >> What was your connection to the artists, and what approach did you have to curating the shows?</mark>
<br>

Many of the artists I knew through Nasty Nets, and I think maybe <a href="http://anotherunknowntime.com/"> Travis Hallenbeck</a> was my
first connection to them.  I originally encountered Travis many years ago on a Beat Happening email list,
although we later had additional random connections.  <a href="http://shareyoursorrow.tumblr.com/"> Kevin Bewersdorf</a> was recommended to me by a friend in the film industry.


I was trying to bring some challenging new media work while 
also playing a bit to the taste of the local Dallas audience so that I didn't totally lose them.
I always asked a lot of people for their opinions when curating.  We did a lot of two-person shows,
which I don't see that often.
</p><br><p>


<mark>	>> At this time, you were also representing some artists. Were there similar galleries representing
>> new media work in NYC and LA? Was there much international interest? </mark>
<br>

Not much in LA that I'm aware of, mostly NY and Europe I think.  The galleries in NY that we worked with


were Team <a href="http://www.coryarcangel.com/">(Cory Arcangel)</a>, Postmasters <a href="http://www.kristinlucas.com/">(Kristin Lucas)</a>, Foxy Production  <a href="http://www.michaelbellsmith.com/"> (Michael Bell-Smith)</a>, and 

VertexList (did a joint show of <a href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/
">JODI</a>).  <a href="
http://www.bitforms.com/">Bitforms</a> and <a href="
http://brycewolkowitz.com/h/">Bryce Wolkowitz</a> were also around back then.


Most of our sales were to European collectors, although we later had a pretty active US collector.

<mark> >> And/Or was early to embrace new media works in particular net-based art. How has internet art 
>> evolved in the years after the gallery?</mark> 
<br>

I've noticed a shift away from conceptual art about code and computers to artwork that seems
to be more visual and performative.
</p><br><p>


<mark> >> How has the recognition of internet art changed the artwork itself or the community of artists?</mark>
<br>
I think it has resulted in a fair amount of work made for the emerging market.  But in general, there is currently
only a substantial market for the most accessible of new media and internet artwork.
</p><br><p>



<mark> >> Wanted to give a quick shout out to the book coming out next fall..
>> What is the book is covering? What's the name of your chapter?</mark> 
<br>



The book is called <a href="http://moussemagazine.it/articolo.mm?id=1054
">Mass Effect</a> by <a href="http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2013/free-forms-opencurating-lauren-cornell">Lauren Cornell</a> and <a href="http://www.edhalter.com/
">Ed Halter</a>.  I'm not sure
about the name of the chapter, but it has a short history of the gallery and I think it will include
some of the pictures I sent you.

<mark> >> Is qotile a scrabble reference??</mark>
<br>


It's actually a reference to the Atari 2600 game<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJwxF1qEZdE">'Yars Revenge'</a>  by Howard Scott Warshaw.
